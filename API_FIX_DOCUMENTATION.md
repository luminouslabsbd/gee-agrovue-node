# 🔧 API FIX DOCUMENTATION - Route Shadowing Issue

## 🎯 Problem Summary

**Error:** `Cannot POST /api/field-analysis/time-series`

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
Express.js was returning "Cannot POST" error for the time-series endpoint even though:
- ✅ The endpoint was defined in `server.js`
- ✅ The server was running
- ✅ Earth Engine was initialized
- ✅ The `/api/field-analysis` endpoint worked fine

### Why It Happened
**Route Shadowing** - A classic Express.js routing issue:

```
Original Order (WRONG):
1. app.post('/api/field-analysis', ...) ← Matches FIRST
2. app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', ...) ← Never reached!

Request to /api/field-analysis/time-series:
- Express checks route 1: /api/field-analysis
- Matches! (because /api/field-analysis is a prefix)
- Route 2 never evaluated
- Result: "Cannot POST" error
```

### Why This Happens
Express matches routes in **order of definition**. When a route pattern matches, Express stops looking for other routes. The less specific route `/api/field-analysis` was matching before the more specific route `/api/field-analysis/time-series` could be evaluated.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### The Fix
**Reorder routes so more specific routes come FIRST:**

```javascript
// CORRECT ORDER:
// 1. More specific routes FIRST
app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', async (req, res) => {
  // Time series endpoint
});

// 2. Less specific routes AFTER
app.post('/api/field-analysis', async (req, res) => {
  // Field analysis endpoint
});
```

### Why This Works
```
New Order (CORRECT):
1. app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', ...) ← Matches FIRST
2. app.post('/api/field-analysis', ...) ← Fallback

Request to /api/field-analysis/time-series:
- Express checks route 1: /api/field-analysis/time-series
- Exact match! ✅
- Route executed
- Result: Success!

Request to /api/field-analysis:
- Express checks route 1: /api/field-analysis/time-series
- No match
- Express checks route 2: /api/field-analysis
- Match! ✅
- Route executed
- Result: Success!
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `server.js`

**Before (Lines 159-271):**
```javascript
// Field Analysis endpoint (FIRST)
app.post('/api/field-analysis', async (req, res) => { ... });

// NDVI Time Series endpoint (SECOND)
app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', async (req, res) => { ... });
```

**After (Lines 159-272):**
```javascript
// NDVI Time Series endpoint (FIRST) ← MOVED UP
app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', async (req, res) => { ... });

// Field Analysis endpoint (SECOND) ← MOVED DOWN
app.post('/api/field-analysis', async (req, res) => { ... });
```

**Key Addition:**
```javascript
// ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This MUST come BEFORE /api/field-analysis to avoid route shadowing
app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', async (req, res) => {
```

## 🧪 Verification

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
**Result:** ✅ `{"status":"ok","message":"Server is running","earthEngineInitialized":true}`

### Test 2: Field Analysis (Original Endpoint)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/field-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fieldBoundary": {...}, "fieldId": "NGR-KD-12345"}'
```
**Result:** ✅ Working (14 seconds response time)

### Test 3: Time Series (Fixed Endpoint)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/field-analysis/time-series \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fieldBoundary": {...},
    "fieldId": "NGR-KD-12345",
    "startDate": "2025-01-01",
    "endDate": "2025-12-31",
    "intervalDays": 10
  }'
```
**Result:** ✅ Working (3 minutes 28 seconds response time)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Express Route Matching Rules
1. **Order matters** - Routes are evaluated in definition order
2. **First match wins** - Express stops at the first matching route
3. **Specificity first** - Always define more specific routes before general ones
4. **Pattern matching** - `/api/field-analysis` matches `/api/field-analysis/time-series`

### Best Practices
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Specific routes first
app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', ...);
app.post('/api/field-analysis/stats', ...);
app.post('/api/field-analysis', ...);

// ❌ WRONG: General routes first
app.post('/api/field-analysis', ...);
app.post('/api/field-analysis/time-series', ...);
app.post('/api/field-analysis/stats', ...);
```

### Route Shadowing Prevention
- Always put more specific routes BEFORE less specific ones
- Use route prefixes carefully
- Consider using Express Router for better organization
- Add comments to clarify route ordering

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Response Times
- **Field Analysis:** ~14 seconds
- **Time Series:** ~3 minutes 28 seconds (longer due to more data processing)

### Why Time Series Takes Longer
1. Queries 365 days of Sentinel-2 data
2. Calculates NDVI for each image
3. Generates 14 time series points
4. Computes statistics
5. Performs trend analysis
6. Formats response

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### If You See "Cannot POST" Again
1. Check route order in `server.js`
2. Ensure specific routes come BEFORE general routes
3. Restart the server
4. Check server logs for errors

### If Response is Slow
1. This is normal for Earth Engine queries
2. Time series takes 3-5 minutes
3. Field analysis takes 10-20 seconds
4. Consider caching for production

### If Data is Missing
1. Check date range (max 2 years)
2. Verify field boundary coordinates
3. Check cloud cover (< 30% filter)
4. Ensure Sentinel-2 data exists for dates
